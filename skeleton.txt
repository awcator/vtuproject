Cyber security IS the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may also be referred to as information technology security.
Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. the practice of testing a computer system, network or web application to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit  is called Penetration testing, also called pen testing or ethical hacking. 
Penetration testing can be automated with software applications or performed manually.Either way, the process involves gathering information about the target before the test, identifying possible entry points, attempting to break in -- either virtually or for real -- and reporting back the findings. The most common php webservers are vulnurable for php type juggling vulnurability and SQL Injection.

The main objective of this project is to provide showlight on these vulnurebalities and how these small vulnurabilites can be exploited by the attacker to cause major damage to the servers. In real life scineario, even after exploiting the servers making Command Execution is the challaning task. Here we have desinged next level command Injection by tunnling Shell over ICMP packets. Usually server filters unkown TCP/UDP port openings for security reasons, so making a command execution 

is nightmare. Whereas ICMP packets are always allowed beyond NAT and Firewall for checking UPHOST status of the server, also commonly known as PINGING. By crafting custom ping packets or ICMP packets with overriding ICMP fragments with custom data we can make  communcation possible with the attacker and the server.
here we also showed, how these vulnurablites are can be avoided and patched for a good secured web service.

Intro:
	Our tool can be used to provide pentesting services for testing WebSecuirty. It compromize the long list of services for both Pentester and Attacker perspective.
Manually pentesting a webserver is a difficult task for various types of payloads and it is a time consuming. Our tool performs pentesting with various payloads automatically with diffrent attacks to fuzz the server.
Our tool also provides Shell Sharing Support, File Sharing Support so we can send and recive files, images, movies from device to device.
It is a single powerfull tool with the capabilities of Network Mapping, Port Scanning, Os FingerPrint Detection, WebFuzzing, SQLInjector and ReverseShell Support using ICMP/TCP/UDP protocols.
